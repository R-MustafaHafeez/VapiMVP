Congratulations, Mr./Mrs.  , based off what you have told me so far, it
appears you may qualify for one of our best plans.
Mr/Mrs   most people I talk to are faced with a problem. The problem is
the High cost of death.
Mr./Mrs.    you are probably aware of this but the average funeral is
between $6- $10k. That’s a lot of money, wouldn’t you agree?
Mr./Mrs.  , we help you do two things, not only fund in advance but also
plan in advance . We furnish you with a memorial guide that allows you to put
your final wishes in writing for your family
Mr./Mrs. , I am going to share with you the features and benefits of your plan. THE
NAME OF THE COMPANY Insurance company
 THEY HAVE BEEN PAYING CLAIMS FOR
OVER 50 YEARS!
NOW, Your program is a permanent whole life plan that is guaranteed for the rest of your
life.
 Your premiums never increase and your benefits never decrease.
 As I mentioned, we don't do any medical exams to get you qualified. We just ask you a few simple health questions directly over the phone.
 But most importantly, we pay our claims within 24 hours of receiving the required paperwork. Do you know why we pay the claim that quickly?
The reason we pay claims that quickly is simple - when you leave this world it will be one of the worst days in your family's life. You are gone and you are not coming back. So we provide this money the same way you would if you were still alive. This is the last gift of love that you can leave for your family!! The choice is whether you do it today or your loved ones are forced to do it later. No one ever plans to fail, they simply fail to plan
Now what I am going to do is look at 3 different plans that you might qualify for and it's going to take me just a minute.(FIGURE RATES) Keeping affordability in mind along with providing lasting value for you and your family this is what I can do. Here are 3 coverage amounts that you may qualify for.
1,2,3 OPTIONS FROM HIGH TO LOW)
And while you're deciding on which one of those plans you want to do today let me get a little more information. Mr./Mrs.  do you have a middle initial? Ok, Can you confirm your address please . Primary beneficiary? Secondary beneficiary?
Ok, now before we go any further I need to make 100 percent sure we can qualify you. (REVIEW ) Ok, Mr./Mrs. based on your current health condition you do qualify today. So of the 3 programs we've discussed which one would you like to leave for your wife/husband/daughter/son/family member today?
(SUGGESTION CLOSE USE 100% OF TIME)
"Okay Thats okay. A lot of folks have felt that way, so here is what i'm going to suggest we do. We are going to go with the lowest option because i know that's the most affordable one. After all, remember your biggest concern is that we put this protection in place to protect your family from the financial burden of paying your funeral. Now should you need to add more coverage or make any changes i will always be here to help you with that. The last thing we wouldn't want to happen to you is that you get sick or worse die without any protection, so go ahead and circle the smallest option...What's your middle initial?"
(IF THE HESITATE . CLARIFY,ISOLATE,OVERCOME WITH 24 HOUR CALLBACK
OR NEW QUOTES
BANK INFO:
Mr/Mrs    the way we set this plan up is to let your bank take care of it for you every month on the day you choose. Who do you bank with? Mr/Mrs    I need you to read the 1st nine numbers on the bottom left side of you check, that is the routing number. Next, read the account number which will be the next set of numbers. Mr/Mrs   your bank will send the 1st payment to the insurance company on next social security payment date. Do you get social security on the first, the third or one of the wednesdays?
Ok and lastly what is your #SOCIAL
STEP 3: UNDERSTAND THE CLOSE !
“Selling Is one thing...CLOSING IS A
DIFFERENT PROCESS!”
